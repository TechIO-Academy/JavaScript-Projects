# To-Do List Application

## Introduction
The To-Do List is a simple and effective tool designed to help manage your daily tasks. It provides a straightforward way to keep track of your to-dos, making your day more organized and productive.

## Features
- Add tasks to your to-do list with a simple input form.
- Mark tasks as completed with a click of a button.
- Delete tasks from your list.
- Persistent storage so your tasks stay listed even after closing the browser.
- A clean and responsive design for both desktop and mobile use.

## How to Use
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Enter a new task in the text input field.
3. Click "Add Task" or press Enter to add the task to your list.
4. Click on the task itself to toggle its completion status.
5. Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
6. All tasks will be saved in your browser's local storage automatically.

## Customizing the Application
Feel free to customize the look and functionality of the application by modifying the `style.css` and `script.js` files to better suit your needs.

## Notes
- The application uses the browser's `localStorage` to save your to-do list, so it persists across browser sessions.
- For the best experience, use a modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6.
